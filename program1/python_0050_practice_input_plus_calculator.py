# Requirement: Plus calculator

int_a = input("Number a: ")
int_b = input("Number b: ")

'''
The actual value here is:
int_a : '12'
int_b : '23'
Both of them are string
'''

result = int_a + int_b
'''
If you add them together, it equals to join them together

'12' + '23' = '1223'
'''


print(f"{int_a} + {int_b} = {result}")


'''
HOMEWORK:
1) explain why the result is 15 when I type 1 and 5 in console.
2) help fix this program so that the result is correct
